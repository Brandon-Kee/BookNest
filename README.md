# üìö BookNest

BookNest is an AI-powered book recommendation app that uses zero-shot classification and semantic search to suggest books based on user-described themes, genre preferences, and emotional tone. Built with the power of **LangChain**, **OpenAI embeddings**, and **Gradio**, BookNest helps users discover their next favorite read in a deeply personalized way.

## Features

- **Semantic Search:** Uses language embeddings to find books closely related to a user's natural language description.
- **Emotion-aware Filtering:** Prioritizes books based on desired emotional tone (e.g., joyful, suspenseful, sad).
- **Genre Customization:** Users can filter results by genre or category.
- **Gradio Interface:** Clean and interactive front-end for seamless user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **LangChain** (`langchain`, `langchain_community`)
- **OpenAI Embeddings**
- **ChromaDB**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy**
- **Gradio**

## Dataset
The app uses a custom CSV dataset that was transformed from the [7k Books](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata) dataset on Kaggle to contain:
- Book metadata (title, authors, ISBN, description, etc.)
- Pre-tagged emotion scores (`joy`, `sadness`, `anger`, etc.)
- Category labels (`simple_categories`)
- Book thumbnails

---
## Process Summary:
- Book descriptions were split into individual sentences.
- Each sentence was classified across 7 emotional dimensions using the [emotion-english-distilroberta-base](https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base) transformer model.
- The **maximum score per emotion** across all sentences was computed for each book.
- Emotional scores were stored alongside each book‚Äôs metadata for downstream filtering.

## How It Works

1. **Input:** User types a description (e.g., _‚ÄúA mysterious journey of self-discovery in a fantasy world‚Äù_).
2. **Filter:** Choose a genre and/or an emotional tone.
3. **Search:** The system performs a semantic similarity search on book descriptions using vector embeddings.
4. **Results:** The top matching books are returned and displayed with cover images and short summaries.

## User Guide

1. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file.
2. Run `dashboard.py`.
3. Click on the `localhost` link that appears in the terminal to access the app.
4. Start getting personalized book recommendations!
